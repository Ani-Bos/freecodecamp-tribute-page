    Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.</p>

<h2>Here's a glimpse of time line of Srinivasa Ramanujan's life:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>1887</strong>- Born in Tamil Nadu(present), India </li>
<li><strong>1892</strong>- Admitted to a local school </li>
<li><strong>1897</strong>- He passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. </li>
<li><strong>1902</strong>- solve cubic equations</li>
<li><strong>1903</strong>- Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems.</li>
<li><strong>1913</strong>- Began a postal correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. 
<li><strong>1904</strong>- Graduated from Town Higher Secondary School, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum.He received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam,but was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process.</li>

<li><strong>1905</strong> Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry for about a month: He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras. There, he passed in mathematics, choosing only to attempt questions that appealed to him and leaving the rest unanswered, but performed poorly in other subjects, such as English, physiology, and Sanskrit. Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and again a year later. Without an FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.</li>

<li><strong>1909</strong>- Ramanujan married Janaki </li>

<li><strong>- One of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of</strong>- (1+(1+(1+(1+......)^0.25)^0.333)^0.5)^0.5 and he find the solution come out as 3</li>
<li><strong>Hardy-Ramunajan number</strong>- 1729= 1^3 + 12^3 = 10^3 + 9^3</li>
<li><strong>1916</strong>- Ramanujan was awarded a Bachelor of Arts by Research degree(the predecessor of the PhD degree)</li>
<li><strong>1917</strong>- Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.</li>
<li><strong>1918</strong>- He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, the second Indian admitted, after Ardaseer Cursetjee in 1841.</li>
<li><strong> At age 31, Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the Royal Society's history. He was elected "for his investigation in elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers."</strong></li>
<li><strong>1918 </strong>- He was the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
<li><strong>1920</strong>- He died at the age of 32</li>
